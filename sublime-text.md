# Sublime Text

## Always open new files/folders in tabs

Sublime Text uses native macOS tabs. By default, newly opened files/folders will only be opened in tabs when Sublime Text is in fullscreen mode. Thereâ€™s a setting to always or never open new files/folders in a new tab:

```json5
{
	"native_tabs": "preferred",
}
```

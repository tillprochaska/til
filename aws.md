# AWS

## Setting SES in a new account

1. Switch to the SES interface and select "manage identities".
2. Verify a new domain, setting up a TXT record for domain verification and multiple records for DKIM.
3. Verify a new email address. A verification link will be emailed to that address.
4. Create a new support ticket, requesting increased sending limits. By default, new AWS account can only send emails to verified addresses and to the SES mailbox simulator.

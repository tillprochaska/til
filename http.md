## `Cache-Control: no-cache` doesn’t mean "Don’t cache!"

> Note that no-cache does not mean "don't cache". no-cache allows caches to store a response but requires them to revalidate it before reuse. If the sense of "don't cache" that you want is actually "don't store", then no-store is the directive to use.
